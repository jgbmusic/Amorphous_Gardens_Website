=========================

Source files for proposed site--existing site is a placeholder.

Experiment with full screen layout.  
Experiment with a single page layout--multiple pages of info without reloading for each page.  
Experiment with jQuery for fading animations.

Still working on how to employ responsive design.

Need to contact customer:
  1.  Need pictures for each subject (all pics are my own for placeholding).
  2.  Prices for CSA (community supported agriculture) share fees.
  3.  Sample listing of produce.
